// Why do we need a function?
 
//Suppose you have to add two numbers let say a and b.
// Tehn you can simply add them by taking its value from the user and adding it by using a+b 
// But what if you have to add 50 sets of such numbers?
// You will repeat the above steps 50 times, right?
// That pretty much doable but what if you are given 1000 such sets of numbers?
// You won't be repeating it for 1000 times right?
// That's where function comes in picture
// They will produce reusuable codes.
// You just have to define it once and then you can reuse it wherever you want.


// Basic Syntax of a function in JavaScript

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3,...){
//code that needs to be executed will go here
}

// There is a difference between parameter and arguement.
// Parameter are variables that are used to take a particular value
// Argument is the value that yoou give to the function so that some operations can be done on them.
